# Java OOP Lab 1 - Shirt and Quotation

## Overview
This is an educational Java project for learning Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) basics. Students create simple Java classes and test them.

## Project Structure
- `src/` - Java source files
  - `Shirt.java` - A class representing a shirt with properties like ID, description, color, price
  - `ShirtTest.java` - Test class to run and display Shirt information
  - `Quotation.java` - A class representing a quotation/quote
  - `QuotationTest.java` - Test class to run and display the quotation
- `Solution/` - Folder for student screenshots and markdown files
- `build.gradle` - Gradle build configuration (for JUnit tests)

## Running the Project
The project runs via a console workflow that:
1. Compiles all Java files in the `src` directory
2. Runs `ShirtTest` to display shirt information
3. Runs `QuotationTest` to display the quotation

## Requirements
- Java (GraalVM 22.3)
- No external dependencies for running the main code
- JUnit 5 for testing (via Gradle)

## Recent Changes
- Initial setup for Replit environment
- Created Shirt.java and Quotation.java files as per lab instructions
